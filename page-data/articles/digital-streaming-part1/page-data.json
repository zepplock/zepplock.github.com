Phase One, in which Doris gets her oats\"\n-- <a href=\"https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_of_Us_(The_Beatles_song)\">\"Two of Us\" by The Beatles</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h3>Preface</h3>\n<p>This article is the first of many articles to cover digital sound. I express my personal views and I'm not affiliated with any manufacturer, reviewer or organization.</p>\n<h3>Goal</h3>\n<p>What I will be discussing in these articles are topics around digital audio archiving, streaming and all kinds of digital equipment. I'll try to explain how sound lives in a digital world, all the way from where sound becomes digital (typically in a studio) to a digital to analog converter (DAC) in your home music system. So I will skip the effects of any analog equipment such as speakers, amplifiers, tubes, etc.</p>\n<p>I also would like to cover topics on archiving, storage, backup and other ways to keep personal music collections safe at home.</p>\n<h3>What is lossless? Analogy #1</h3>\n<p>Since these articles are not intended for people with a scientific background, I will use analogies a lot. Let's try one really quick.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-text line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-text\"> Take a simple 16bit 44.1khz CD audio. It has lots of megabytes of data.\n Imagine every megabyte is a cotton ball and we have a handful of those balls.\n Now let&#39;s put it into a shoebox - that&#39;s our &#39;.WAV&#39; file.\n If we stuff all cotton balls into an Altoids box - we get a &#39;.FLAC&#39; file.</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>The moral of this analogy is that packing and unpacking cotton balls into 2 different boxes does not change the weight of cotton balls. This process does not remove any nor add anything extra. What FLAC does really well is packing and unpacking fluffy cotton since it has a lot of air in-between cotton fibers. In fact, FLAC can do it as many times as you want, so you can do <code class=\"language-text\">WAV-&gt;FLAC-&gt;WAV</code> encoding/decoding without losing nor adding any data. This type of codec is called <strong>Lossless</strong>.</p>\n<h3>The Sources</h3>\n<p>Going forward, let's identify a few sound sources of musical content. </p>\n<h4>Source A</h4>\n<p>The first one (we will call it <code class=\"language-text\">source A</code>) is a single track from a good old-fashioned Audio CD in 16bit 44.1khz (we will call it <code class=\"language-text\">16/44</code>). This is a well-recorded piece of music from, let's say, the 70s. Originally recorded to an analog master tape and later digitized for CD distribution. We don't really care how or when digital conversion happened.</p>\n<h4>Source B</h4>\n<p>The next one (we will call it <code class=\"language-text\">source B</code>) is a state of the art modern recording, recorded directly to digital media in 24bit and 96khz (<code class=\"language-text\">24/96</code>).</p>\n<h3>Lies, truths, and everything in-between</h3>\n<h4>Lie #1: upsampling/upconverting</h4>\n<p>Let's imagine that some streaming service or online store decides to convert <code class=\"language-text\">source A</code> to 24bit 96khz (<code class=\"language-text\">24/96</code>). They are calling it HiRez music and selling it for 2x of a regular <code class=\"language-text\">16/44</code>. So what exactly happens? Let's do another analogy:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-text line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-text\">We have a shoebox full of cotton balls.\nThey took it and stuffed it into ~3x larger container - like a 5lb bucket.</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>We have the same music, same quality, same content but it takes more time to download and stream. Most importantly, it sounds the same too!</p>","excerpt":"\"...
