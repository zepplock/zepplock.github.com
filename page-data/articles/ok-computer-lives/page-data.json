This album was literally the biggest rock album of late 90s, a cornerstone of Radiohead's music. What came after \"Ok Computer\" was a shift into more electronic sounding music. It is not like their music changed, they just started to use other instruments and techniques which was not to my liking.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward 11 years to 2008 and a release of double CD album called \"In Rainbows\" which put everything back on track. The music, the melody, the acoustic guitar - everything is back, tuned to perfection, spiced up by Thom's voice. Recently I re-listened to \"In Rainbows\" and tried to get more information on songs, where they came from and what they mean.</p>\n<p>It also turned out that one of my favourite songs from this album \"Last Flowers to the Hospital\" is an outtake from the \"Ok Computer\" sessions.</p>\n<p>Which explained a lot especially the resemblance of two albums and matching music styles. I highly recommend <a href=\"http://RADIOHEAD.COM\">Radiohead</a> to anyone who is not familiar with their work, especially albums like \"Ok Computer\" and \"In Rainbows\".</p>\n<center>\n  <iframe width=\"400\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/y6PrVmoIC1A\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  <iframe width=\"400\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/8nTFjVm9sTQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<center>","excerpt":"I know the title of this post is a bit cryptic.
