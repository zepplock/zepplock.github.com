## Preface

This article is a first of many articles to cover digital sound. I express my personal views and I'm not affiliated with any manufacturer, reviewer or organization.

## Goal

What I will be discussing in these articles are topics around digital audio archiving, streaming and all kinds of digital equipment. I'll try to explain how sound lives in digital world, all the way from where sound becomes digital (typically in a studio) to a digital to analog converter (DAC) in your home music system. So I will skip effects of any analog equipment such as speakers, amplifiers, tubes, etc.

I also would like to cover topics on archiving, storage, backup and other ways to keep personal music collections safe at home.

## Analogies

Since these articles are not intended for people with scientific background, I will use analogies a lot. Let's try one really quick.
