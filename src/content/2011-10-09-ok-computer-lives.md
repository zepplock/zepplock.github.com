I know the title of this post is a bit cryptic. It is not about computers at all. It is about Radiohead's album called "Ok Computer".

I have always been a big fan of [Radiohead](http://RADIOHEAD.COM) and coming back to "Ok Computer" is like meeting a good friend. Just listen to this:

Songs like "Karma Police" and "Paranoid Android" is what defined [Radiohead](http://RADIOHEAD.COM) as a band in 90s: a perfect mix of slow, moody and downbeat rock. This album was literally the biggest rock album of late 90s, a cornerstone of Radiohead's music. What came after "Ok Computer" was a shift into more electronic sounding music. It is not like their music changed, they just started to use other instruments and techniques which was not to my liking.

Fast-forward 11 years to 2008 and a release of double CD album called "In Rainbows" which put everything back on track. The music, the melody, the acoustic guitar - everything is back, tuned to perfection, spiced up by Thom's voice. Recently I re-listened to "In Rainbows" and tried to get more information on songs, where they came from and what they mean.

It also turned out that one of my favourite songs from this album "Last Flowers to the Hospital" is an outtake from the "Ok Computer" sessions.

Which explained a lot especially the resemblance of two albums and matching music styles. I highly recommend [Radiohead](http://RADIOHEAD.COM) to anyone who is not familiar with their work, especially albums like "Ok Computer" and "In Rainbows".
